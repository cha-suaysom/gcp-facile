# gcp-tensorRT

This repository sets up the as-a-service server on Google Cloud Platform (gcp) to perform deep neural network. In addition to the GPU available in gcp, we also plan to integrate tensorRT to this server. The steps necessary to set up the server can be found in [mnist-grpc](https://github.com/JackDinsmore/mnist-server-grpc/tree/tpu) 

We use FACILE algorithm
